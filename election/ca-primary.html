This is an extended statement of how I voted in the California primary and why.  If you know me at all well you will know that I generally lean to the left politically and vote Democratic most of the time.  But I but generally find evidence-based arguments more convincing than ones based on ideology.  Sanders is generally closer to my overall political preferences in terms of favoring a German or Scandinavian-style social market economy but I’m voting for Clinton, mostly because I am convinced of the following:

1) Math is math and Clinton will be the nominee
No, she won’t have enough pledged delegates to win (neither did Obama) but she’s far enough ahead that it doesn’t matter; it would be totally unacceptable for the super delegates to vote en mass for Sanders at this point.  If you aren’t convinced of this based on the large lead in the popular vote, pledged delegates, and the endorsement of most super delegates I can only say you haven’t been paying attention.

2) Sanders supporters are behaving badly
The first few months and the early Clinton-Sanders debates were very respectful and probably helped move inter party discussions forward, but not any more.  Sanders has been better than his supporters, who at this point are often just repeating republican talking points about Clinton being untrustworthy and crooked.

3) The process is hurting the Democratic party
…and so I want it over.  It’s served its purpose and its time to get on to coming together for the general election.

Minor supporting points:

4) Clinton has won fair and square
Bernie Sanders has, and to an even greater extent the Sandersistas have leveled a lot of accusations at the Clinton campaign that don’t stand up to scruitiny (not a defense of the primary process - it sucks and we should do something about it):
Voter suppression - it’s a real issue but has nothing to do with Clinton.  Its due to Republicans attempting to suppress minority voters and has probably hurt Clinton more than Sanders.  And of course by far the greatest source of voter suppression is the caucus system, which has hugely benefited Sanders (in fact, it is probably not too much to say they have kept him in the game - consider the difference between primary and caucus results in Nebraska and Washington).
Voter fraud - based on exit polls.  This is a really irresponsible thing to be claiming without evidence.  As far as I can tell the exit poll argument is not taken seriously by anyone with a background in statistics or polling.  And do you think Clinton also rigged the non-binding votes in Nebraska and Washington?
Delegate allocation rules - They are arbitrary and often bad, but any sane delegate allocation system would have Clinton way ahead.
Media bias - This is harder to quantify (although some people have tried), but from my perspective Sanders has gotten very generous treatment from the media and the overwhelming bias has been to portray the race as closer than it really is, to emphasize the divide within the Democratic party, and to feed the Sanders supporters’ (mostly wrong, more on this later) sense of grievance.
Not enough debates/debate schedule, etc. - There have been thirteen debates, do you really think more would make a difference?
Super delegates - Maybe we should get rid of them, its worth a discussion.  Sanders & co were against them early, but now are trying to hector them into overriding the clear winner of the primaries because they can’t win without them.

5)Sanders and his supporters often argue that he is a stronger general election candidate.  I do not find this convincing.
Sanders polls better in a hypothetical matchup with Trump.  I think this is largely an artifact of the gentle treatment the candidate has received from the news media and the Clinton campaign.  I think Sanders would be VERY vulnerable to a negative campaign focusing on such things as:
Participated in anti-us rallies in Nicaragua, apparently joined in anti-us chants.
Wrote some creepy sex stories long ago, some of which featured a woman enjoying being raped
Voted against amber alert system, and some laws against computer-generated child porn
Voted against criminalizing computer-generated child porn
Honeymooned with his second wife in the Soviet Union
None of these issues will matter to his core supporters (or really to me), but they have the potential to absolutely crater his support in the general population.  Low-information voters like Sanders now because the perceive him to be independent and honest (which he is), but would likely turn on him in the face of a negative campaign built around the points noted above.  He might still win, no way to know, but it’s nowhere near as simple as just looking at the polls.

Caveat:

Clinton is nowhere near my platonic ideal candidate and I agree with some of the common criticisms of her (not all of them).  But I don’t see her as risky and think she’ll be not much better or worse than her husband was.  I expect from her:

1) Two or Three reasonably good Supreme Court justices.  This will likely result in the overturning of Citizens United, and if you think there is too much money in politics you should care about this a lot

2) Some positive signing statements, and prioritization directives to executive agencies. She'll be able to use that effectively, because whatever else, she is a politician and she knows how to push buttons in DC.

That’s about it.  My biggest fear is her general hawkishness in the area of foreign policy.

Exercise for the reader:
Stop hyperfocusing on the top of the ticket.  If everyone who helped elect Obama had showed up in 2010 we’d be in a much better place.  If the Sanders coalition can make it to the polls in 2018 they’ll be able to get most of what they want from Clinton.  Progressives need to stop operating as a cult of personality — for Dean, Obama, Sanders, whoever — and start working every single election at every level to build a progressive movement.  The Conservatives learned this with Goldwater, by focusing on local races and party infrastructures they eventually got Regan, etc.  I’m no fan of the Tea Party but they do understand this and that’s why they are getting their way so much.
