On October 23rd I'm going to be presenting to the SF Cyber Security Meetup, the subject being the phishing site capture described in my Medium.com article.  Will include discussion of how such attacks are constructed, how to avoid, and how to protect your customers if you run an ecommerce site.  We will also run the phishing code in a controlled environment fopr an in-depth look at how it functions and what lessons can be learned.  If you are interested [this is](http://www.meetup.com/SF-Cyber-Security/events/210663472/) the link.  Thanks to [Tech Liminal](http://techliminal.com/) for hosting.
